## Week 1

Python for Data Science and statistics

End of Week Project:

1) Write different functions that will calculate the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, percentiles of a list containing many different numbers

2)Use the random module to create a rock paper scissors game.

## Week 2

Data Analysis with Python using Pandas and Numpy

A dataset from kaggle will be used and we’ll be doing some analysis on the data and also to wrangle the data.

## Week 3

Data Visualization with Python using  Matplotlib and Seaborne

End of Week Project:

A dataset from kaggle will be used and we’ll be doing some visualization on the data.

## Week 4

We’ll be working on a dataset as a project which will cover all we’ve done so far  

Project detail:  A more complex dataset will be used where we will be analyzing and visualizing the data then try to make sense out of the raw data given.
